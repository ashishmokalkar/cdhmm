# cdhmm
An easy to use python library consisting implementation of Continuous Density Hidden Markov Models.

Continuous Density Hidden Markov Models(CD-HMM) are a type of HMM which consists of Emission probabilities in the form of a distribution like gaussian or uniform distribution. Despite its use in Speech processing, very less codes are available on the internet regarding CD-HMM. This library has implementation of all HMM algorithms applied on continuous density observations.

After studying Hidden Markov Models(HMM) for a while now, I have came across many python libraries which implements HMM algorithms like forward,  backward, Viterbi and Baum-Welch. However, most of these libraries work on discrete observations. cdhmm library is developed for can be used to do HMM operations on Continuous observations.
